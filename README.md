# Node-Warrior

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/kumavis/node-warrior.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
A 3D multiplayer voxel game with a code gun!
It's a gun that shoots code you wrote into the world!

## Game
Try it out [here](http://kumavis.github.io/node-warrior).
To start, host a game, create a world, then select that world to host.
Share the URL with friends and they will join your game.

## Dependencies
First you'll need to make sure you have `git` and `node` installed.
You can check this by going to your command line and typing `git -v` and `node -v`.
If you get a `command not found` message, install the missing tool:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)


## Installation
To start contributing to this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/kumavis/node-warrior.git
cd node-warrior
npm install

Grunt will now do some work for you and get the server running.
